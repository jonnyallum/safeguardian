## Data Flow Architecture

### Message Processing Pipeline

The message processing pipeline implements a sophisticated multi-stage analysis system that processes social media interactions in real-time while maintaining strict privacy and security controls.

#### Stage 1: Message Capture
Messages are intercepted at the mobile application level using platform-specific APIs and monitoring techniques. The capture process implements selective filtering to focus on text-based communications while respecting platform terms of service and user privacy expectations.

#### Stage 2: Preprocessing
Captured messages undergo initial preprocessing including normalization, tokenization, and metadata extraction. This stage implements privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy and selective redaction to minimize exposure of sensitive information.

#### Stage 3: AI Analysis
Preprocessed messages are analyzed using a multi-model ensemble that includes transformer-based language models, behavioral analysis algorithms, and risk scoring mechanisms. The analysis process implements real-time processing with sub-second response times.

#### Stage 4: Risk Assessment
AI analysis results are combined with contextual information, user history, and behavioral patterns to generate comprehensive risk scores. The assessment process implements adaptive thresholds that learn from guardian feedback and system performance metrics.

#### Stage 5: Alert Generation
High-risk interactions trigger immediate alert generation with appropriate escalation levels. The alert system implements intelligent routing based on guardian preferences, time zones, and emergency contact hierarchies.

#### Stage 6: Evidence Collection
All flagged interactions are automatically preserved in forensic-grade storage with full chain of custody tracking. The evidence collection process implements cryptographic integrity verification and automated backup procedures.
